                      One day the kingdom of the peaceful mushroom people was
                      invaded by the Koopa, a tribe of turtles famous for their
                      black magic. The quiet, peace-loving Mushroom People were
                      turned into mere stones, bricks and even field horsehair
                      plants, and the Mushroom Kingdom fell into ruin.<br /><br />The
                      only one who can undo the magic spell on the Mushroom
                      People and return them to their normal selves is the
                      Princess Toadstool, the daughter of the Mushroom King.
                      Unfortunately, she is presently in the hands of Bowser,
                      the King of the Koopa.<br /><br />Mario hears about the
                      Mushroom People’s plight and sets out on a quest to free
                      the Mushroom Princess from the evil Koopa and restore the
                      fallen kingdom of the Mushroom People. You are Mario! It’s
                      up to you to save the Mushroom People from the black magic
                      of the Koopa!

                      One evening, Mario had a strange dream. He dreamt of a
                      long, long stairway leading up to a door. As soon as the
                      door opened, he was confronted with a world he had never
                      seen before spreading out as far as his eyes could see.
                      When he strained his ears to listen, he heard a faint
                      voice saying, "Welcome to Subcon, the land of dreams. We
                      have been cursed by Wart and we are completely under his
                      evil spell. We have been awaiting your arrival. Please
                      defeat Wart and return Subcon to its natural state. The
                      curse Wart has put on you in the real world will not have
                      any effect upon you here. Remember, Wart hates vegetables.
                      Please help us!"
                      <br /><br />
                      At the same time this was heard, a bolt of lightning
                      flashed before Mario’s eyes. Stunned, Mario lost his
                      footing and tumbled upside down. He awoke with a start to
                      find himself sitting up in his bed. To clear his head,
                      Mario talked to Luigi, Toad and Princess Peach about the
                      strange dream he had. They decided to go to a nearby
                      mountain for a picnic.
                      <br /><br />
                      After arriving at the picnic area and looking at the
                      scenery, they see a small cave nearby. When they enter
                      this cave, to their great surprise, there’s a stairway
                      leading up, up and up. It is exactly like the one Mario
                      saw in his dream. They all walk together up the stairs and
                      at the top, find a door just like the one in Mario’s
                      dream. When Mario and his friends, in fear, open the door,
                      to their surprise, the world that he saw in his dream
                      spreads out before them!

                      The Mushroom Kingdom has been a peaceful place thanks to
                      the brave deeds of Mario and Luigi. The Mushroom Kingdom
                      forms an entrance to the Mushroom World where all is not
                      well. Bowser has sent his 7 children to make mischief as
                      they please in the normally peaceful Mushroom World.
                      <br /><br />
                      They stole the royal magic wands from each country in the
                      Mushroom World and used them to turn their kings into
                      animals. Mario and Luigi must recover the royal magic
                      wands from Bowser’s 7 kids to return the kings to their
                      true forms. “Goodbye and good luck!” said the Princess and
                      Toad as Mario and Luigi set off on their journey deep into
                      the Mushroom World.

                      Having returned peace to Mushroom World, Mario and Luigi
                      decide to take a leisurely vacation with Princess Peach.
                      They set out for Yoshi’s Island in the magical island
                      nation of Dinosaur Land far to the south.
                      <br /><br />
                      But soon after arriving on the island, Princess Peach
                      suddenly disappears. As Mario and Luigi desperately search
                      for her, they discover a strange egg on the outskirts of
                      the island. Then, before their very eyes, an odd little
                      dragon hatches! The dragon calls himself Yoshi and says,
                      "Monstrous turtles recently appeared here in this Dinosaur
                      Land. They have used magic to seal my friends inside eggs.
                      I tried to help them, but the turtles are incredibly
                      strong and cast a spell on me, too… Will you please come
                      with me to rescue my friends?"
                      <br /><br />
                      What can this mean? Apparently, Bowser hasn’t learned his

                    <p>Story (from the original instruction booklet)</p>
                    <p>
                      This story happend a long long time ago … This is a story
                      about a baby and Yoshi … A stork hurries across the dusky,
                      pre-dawn sky, In his bill, he supports a pair of twins,
                      who are to be delivered to their parents as soon as
                      possible. Suddenly, something appears between the clouds
                      and races towards the stork with blinding speed!
                      <br /><br />
                      “SSCCRREEEEECH!!!”, it screams. “These babies are mine!”
                      <br /><br />
                      Snatching only one baby, the creature vanishes into the
                      darkness from whence it came.
                      <br /><br />
                      Oh no! The second baby falls undetected towards the open
                      sea … The kidnapper is Kamek, an evil Magikoopa from the
                      Koopa Kingdom having divined last night that twin babies
                      born this morning will bring disaster to the Koopa family.
                      He arranged for an early morning ambush returning to his
                      castle. Kamek realizes that he missed the other baby. He
                      order his toadies.
                      <br /><br />
                      “Go forth and find the other baby!! Don’t let his parents
                      get him back! Ever!!”
                      <br /><br />
                      Meanwhile, the second baby does not fall into the sea
                      after all … It lands safely on Yoshi’s back! And right
                      after him drops a map!! This paradise is Yoshi’s Island
                      and on this island lives lots of different Yoshies. These
                      Yoshies are naturally laid back and relaxed but this is a
                      calamity and everyone is in a state of panic. As the
                      Yoshies frantically yell over each other. the baby
                      insistently points at something.
                      <br /><br />
                      Yes! The baby can sense the other baby’s location. All the
                      Yoshies quickly agree to help carry the baby to its
                      destination by using a relay system not unlike the old
                      pony express.
                      <br /><br />
                      The Green Yoshi draws first honors.

                    <p>
                      Once upon a time, there was a peaceful world called
                      Sarasaland. In this world there were 4 kingdoms named
                      Birabuto, Muda, Easton and Chai.
                      <br /><br />
                      One day, the skies of Sarasaland were suddenly covered by
                      a huge black cloud. From a crack in this cloud, the
                      unknown space monster Tatanga emerged to try to conquer
                      Sarasaland.
                      <br /><br />
                      Tatanga hypnotized the people of all the kingdoms so that
                      he could control them in any way he liked. In this way he
                      took over Sarasaland. Now, he wants to marry Princess
                      Daisy of Sarasaland and make her his queen.
                      <br /><br />
                      Mario came to know of these events, and he has started on
                      a journey to the Chai Kingdom where Princess Daisy is held
                      captive, in order to restore peace to Sarasaland.
                      <br /><br />
                      Can Mario defeat Tatanga, release people from his
                      interstellar hypnosis, and rescue Princess Daisy? It's all
                      up to you and Mario's skill. Go for it Mario!

                      While I was away crusading against the mystery alien
                      Tatanga in Sarasa Land, an evil creep took over my castle
                      and put the people of Mario Land under his control with a
                      magic spell. This intruder goes by the name of Wario. He
                      mimics my appearance, and has tried to steal my castle
                      many times. It seems he has succeeded this time.
                      <br /><br />
                      Wario has scattered the 6 Golden Coins from my castle all
                      over Mario Land. These Golden Coins are guarded by those
                      under Wario's spell. Without these coins, we can't get
                      into the castle to deal with Wario. We must collect the 6
                      coins, attack Wario in the castle, and save everybody!

                    <p>Summary</p>
                    <p>
                      Mario Kart DS is a racing game in which the player races
                      in a kart against other racers as one of twelve characters
                      from the Mario series. These characters are Mario, Luigi,
                      Peach, Toad, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Wario, and Bowser, with
                      unlockable characters being Daisy, Dry Bones, Waluigi and
                      R.O.B. To start, only 2 karts are available for each
                      character. An additional kart can be unlocked once some
                      progress is made, and when all 150cc cups are completed
                      with B rank or better, each 12 characters have access to
                      all the 36 karts.
                      <br /><br />
                      While racing or battling, the Nintendo DS's top screen
                      offers a third-person perspective of the player's kart,
                      while the bottom touchscreen shows the race's current
                      standings, items carried by each racer, and a map of the
                      course. The bottom screen can be toggled to show either an
                      overview of the entire course, or a bird's-eye view of the
                      player's kart and the immediate vicinity, including nearby
                      racers, course hazards, item boxes, and incoming attacks.
                      <br /><br />
                      Each course features item boxes that the player can drive
                      through to receive a randomly selected item, which the
                      player can use to gain an advantage over other racers.
                      Some items allow the player to attack other racers to slow
                      them down, while other items can be used to speed up the
                      player's own kart to pass other racers more easily.[5]
                      <br /><br />
                      There are two new items: the Bullet Bill, which transforms
                      the player into a Bullet Bill that autopilots the track,
                      and the Blooper, which squirts ink on all racers ahead of
                      the user, blocking their vision.
                      <br /><br />
                      Unlike the other versions of Mario Kart, Mario Kart DS
                      allows players to avoid the Spiny Shell (Blue Shell)
                      without any aid from items. This can be done by releasing
                      the mini-turbo right before the Spiny Shell hits the
                      player. This requires precise timing, and it is one of the
                      most difficult skills to acquire in the game. Furthermore,
                      this trick is mainly only possible in 150cc or Mirror
                      mode. However, it is also possible in 100cc, but only on
                      tracks such as Frappe Snowland, where the terrain is more
                      slippery.

                      Emergency News Flash!
                      <br /><br />
                      Princess Peach has been kidnapped! While enjoying a picnic
                      with Mario, the beloved ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom was
                      whisked away by an unknown assailant. How could this
                      happen with Mario around?
                      <br /><br />
                      According to Mario, the walk was going swimmingly when
                      Mario and the princess spotted smoke billowing out of
                      Peach’s Castle. The mustachioed marvel immediately jumped
                      into action and sped off toward the fire. The moment he
                      left her side, the princess vanished!
                      <br /><br />
                      Who’s behind Princess Peach’s disappearance? Who’s behind
                      the attack on Peach’s Castle? Are the two incidents
                      related? Didn’t Bowser Jr. once think Princess Peach might
                      be his mother?
                      <br /><br />
                      Looks like Mario’s going to need all the Mega Mushrooms he
                      can find to get to the bottom of this mess.

                      Every hundred years, a huge comet flies by in the skies
                      above the Mushroom Kingdom. One year, that comet filled
                      the entire sky, and from it fell a stream of shooting
                      stars. The Toads scooped up the Star Bits and brought them
                      to the castle, where they were reborn as a great Power
                      Star. It was a happy time in the Mushroom Kingdom. Then
                      one night Mario received a letter...
                      <br /><br />
                      “Dear Mario, I’ll be waiting for you at the castle on the
                      night of the Star Festival. There’s something I’d like to
                      give you. from Peach”
                      <br /><br />
                      With invitation in hand, Mario headed off to the castle
                      just as the Star Festival was getting into full swing.
                      Surrounded by Toads gleefully trying to catch falling Star
                      Bits, Mario was looking forward to the night’s
                      festivities. But then, something happened...

                      Today is Princess Peach’s birthday, so her castle is full
                      of presents. Mario and Luigi are there, and they’re
                      celebrating with the Toads and Princess Peach when a huge
                      birthday cake arrives. Who in the world could it be from?
                      <br /><br />
                      Suddenly, Bowser Jr. and minions jump out of the cake.
                      Everyone is shocked and pandemonium ensues. In a flash,
                      the invaders snatch Princess Peach and fly away in a giant
                      Airship.
                      <br /><br />
                      The Toads are in a panic! Mario and Luigi—and Yellow Toad,
                      Blue Toad and Yoshi too!—pursue the Airship in order to
                      rescue Princess Peach.
                      <br /><br />
                      Together, the four head out on an adventurous journey!

                    <p>
                      The story begins with the Yoshis, who live peacefully on
                      Yoshi's Island. At the topmost peak of the island sits a
                      gem-set artifact known as the Sundream Stone, which
                      possesses the power to "make anyone's wildest dreams come
                      true". One day, when Kamek and Baby Bowser attempt to
                      steal the stone, its gems are sent flying across the
                      world, leaving Yoshi and his friends to recover them.
                      <br /><br />
                      For most of the game, the stone rests in a dark forest
                      guarded by the Yoshis not exploring. When the Yoshis
                      reattach a Dream Gem, the colors on the actual stone that
                      is the color of the Dream Gem are restored. During the
                      final level, the Yoshis find the last Dream Gem, only for
                      Kamek and Baby Bowser to steal it and the Stone with the
                      other four gems. Baby Bowser then uses the stone to create
                      a robot named The Great King Bowser, the penultimate boss.
                      After its defeat Kamek uses the stone to grow Baby Bowser
                      giant, which leads into the final boss fight against Mega
                      Baby Bowser. Afterwards, the Yoshis reattach the gems
                      (which were detached again after the defeat of Mega Baby
                      Bowser) and restore the Sundream Stone, which, with the
                      Yoshis' dreams, creates an airship that is used to fly all
                      of them back to Yoshi's Island.
